# NOTE:
# This test case illustrates the high-level issues solved by the plugin. The unit tests that are 
# not commented out are the ones that demonstrate correct behavior. 
# 
# The unit tests that *are* commented out demonstrate the incorrect behavior that was fixed. To 
# see the incorrect behavior demonstrated, comment out the contents of /init.rb and uncomment out 
# the unit tests starting with test_incorrect*, then run those tests. Be sure to put everything
# back to the way it was after you're done poking around, though :)
